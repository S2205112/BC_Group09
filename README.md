# Dadok -  Decentralized Academic Degree Operation Keeper 

## Blockchain based DApp for verifying academic credentials

Dadok is a decentralized application (DApp) designd to simplify and secure the verification process of academic credentials using blockchain technology. By recording academic degrees and credentials on the blockchain, individuals and institutions can easily verify educational achivements. This approach ensures the authenticity and integrity of academic records, making the verification process more efficient and trustworthy. 

## Functionality
Our DApp creates the possibility for universities and academic institutions to create, store and display students accomplished achevements. After the course has been created can the examinor grade the students who have completed the course by making a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain. The credentials are automatically verified and published on the blockchain in real time for students to access. This will ensure the trustworthiness and integrety of the grades. All transactions and results are immuatable and verifiable, making them less vulnerable to fraud and manipualtion.
